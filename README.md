# Simple-Scrolling-Parallax
Simple scrolling parallax (not true parallax). 

Uses only HTML &amp; CSS. 

Works with all major browsers - Full support with IE11+, Edge, Firefox 47+, Chrome 49+, Safari 9.1+, Opera 39+. WARNING: currently not supported in mobile browsers - Use media query / user-agent sniffer to check for device.

How it works?
The parallax works by styling the background image element to have the attribute: background-attachment: fixed; (default is 'scroll', if not indicated). Can just be called 'fixed' if used as shortcut in 'background:' attribute along with other attributes.
